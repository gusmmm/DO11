# Data Science Workflow Project

This project provides a structured workflow for data science projects, specifically focused on machine learning tasks. It offers a menu-driven interface for performing various data science operations.

## Required Libraries

The project requires the following Python libraries:

- pandas: For data manipulation and analysis
- numpy: For numerical operations
- matplotlib: For data visualization
- seaborn: For advanced visualizations
- tabulate: For formatted table output in the terminal
- colorama: For colored terminal output
- scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms (when implemented)

Install required packages using:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn tabulate colorama scikit-learn
```
Workflow Steps
The application follows these standard data science workflow steps:

Data Loading and Exploration

Load the CSV dataset
Display basic statistics
Show missing values analysis
Data Preprocessing

Extract target variable ('YY_Infant_Mortality_Rate_Imr_Total_Person')
Remove columns starting with 'ZZ' and 'YY'
Handle missing values
Feature Engineering (to be implemented)

Create new features
Transform existing features
Select important features
Model Selection and Training (to be implemented)

Split data into training and testing sets
Select machine learning algorithms
Train models
Model Evaluation (to be implemented)

Evaluate model performance
Compare different models
Fine-tune hyperparameters
Make Predictions (to be implemented)

Make predictions on new data
Export results
Usage
To run the application:
python main.py

Then follow the menu prompts to navigate through the data science workflow.


Don't forget to create the appropriate directory structure:

```python
# This file makes the 'utils' directory a Python package
