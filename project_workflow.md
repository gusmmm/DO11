  - **Methods**: 
    - `load_data(features_path, target_path)`: Loads preprocessed feature and target datasets from specified file paths, performs validation checks to ensure data integrity (checking for correct file formats, matching indices, and compatible dimensions), and combines them for analysis. The method handles potential errors such as missing files or format inconsistencies gracefully, providing informative error messages. It verifies that the target variable is properly aligned with feature records and that there are no integrity issues in the join operation. Returns the combined DataFrame for further analysis.
    
    - `get_basic_stats(include_percentiles=True, include_shape_metrics=True)`: Calculates comprehensive descriptive statistics for all numeric features in the dataset, providing insights into data distribution characteristics. The statistics include measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode), dispersion (standard deviation, variance, range, IQR), and optionally shape metrics (skewness, kurtosis) that help identify non-normal distributions requiring transformation. When include_percentiles is True, it calculates key percentiles (5th, 25th, 50th, 75th, 95th) to better understand data distribution. The method handles missing values appropriately and provides counts of non-null values for each feature. Returns a DataFrame of statistics organized by feature, with metrics as columns.
    
    - `analyze_correlations(threshold=0.7, method='pearson', visualize=True, figsize=(12, 10))`: Identifies and visualizes feature correlations using the specified method ('pearson', 'spearman', or 'kendall'), highlighting potentially multicollinear features above the specified threshold. This helps identify redundant features and strong predictors of the target variable. The method calculates the full correlation matrix, then filters for high correlations exceeding the threshold. When visualize is True, it generates a correlation heatmap using seaborn with customizable figure size. For pairs above threshold, it generates scatter plots to visually confirm relationships. The method addresses potential issues like non-numeric features and handles large correlation matrices by visually emphasizing the most significant correlations. Returns a tuple containing the correlation matrix and a list of highly correlated feature pairs with their correlation coefficients.
    
    - `identify_outliers(method='iqr', threshold=1.5, visualize=True)`: Detects outliers across all numeric features using the selected method (IQR, z-score, modified z-score, or percentile), then quantifies their impact on distribution metrics. For the IQR method, values outside Q1-threshold*IQR and Q3+threshold*IQR are flagged as outliers. For z-score methods, observations beyond the specified threshold standard deviations are identified. The method calculates the percentage of outliers for each feature and summarizes their influence on mean and variance. When visualize is True, it generates box plots or histograms highlighting detected outliers. For features with many outliers, it recommends appropriate transformation techniques or treatment strategies. Returns a dictionary mapping feature names to arrays of outlier indices, along with summary statistics about outlier prevalence and impact.
    
    - `perform_feature_importance(method='mutual_info', target=None, n_neighbors=3, discrete_features='auto')`: Estimates initial feature importance using non-model specific methods to identify potentially predictive variables before formal modeling. When method is 'mutual_info', it calculates mutual information between each feature and the target variable, accounting for both linear and non-linear relationships. Alternative methods include 'f_regression' for linear relationships and 'chi2' for categorical features. The parameter n_neighbors controls the neighborhood size for entropy estimation in mutual information calculations, while discrete_features specifies which features should be treated as discrete. The analysis handles categorical variables appropriately by encoding them if necessary. Returns a DataFrame of features ranked by importance score, providing an early indication of which health indicators may be most relevant to the target outcome.
    
    - `analyze_missing_values(visualize=True, figsize=(12, 6))`: Performs comprehensive analysis of missing values in the dataset, calculating the percentage of missing data per feature and identifying patterns in missingness. When visualize is True, it uses the missingno library to create matrix and bar plots showing the distribution and potential relationships between missing values. The method evaluates whether missing data occurs randomly (MCAR), conditionally randomly (MAR), or non-randomly (MNAR), and suggests appropriate imputation strategies based on the pattern. It also identifies features with excessive missing values that might need exclusion. Returns a DataFrame summarizing missing value statistics for each feature, including counts and percentages.
    
    - `analyze_categorical_features(max_categories=20)`: Examines categorical variables in the dataset to understand their cardinality, distribution, and potential encoding needs. For each categorical feature, it calculates the number of unique categories, frequency distribution, and entropy to measure information content. Features with high cardinality (exceeding max_categories) are flagged for potential dimensionality reduction. The method visualizes category distributions using bar charts and identifies imbalanced categories that might require special handling during modeling. It also suggests appropriate encoding strategies (one-hot, target, ordinal) based on cardinality and distribution characteristics. Returns a dictionary with categorical feature statistics and recommended preprocessing approaches.
    
    - `explore_target_distribution(bins=30, kde=True)`: Analyzes the distribution of the target variable to understand its characteristics and identify potential transformation needs for modeling. The method creates histograms with optional kernel density estimation plots to visualize the distribution shape. It calculates skewness, kurtosis, and performs normality tests (Shapiro-Wilk or D'Agostino's K² test) to quantify deviation from normality. For heavily skewed targets, it suggests appropriate transformations (log, square root, Box-Cox) and demonstrates their effect on distribution. The method also identifies potential discretization approaches if needed for classification tasks. Returns a dictionary containing target distribution statistics and visualization objects.
    
    - `identify_high_variance_features(threshold=0.1)`: Detects features with low variance that may have limited predictive value due to their near-constant values. The method calculates the normalized variance for each feature (adjusting for different scales) and flags those below the specified threshold. Such features often contribute little to model performance while increasing dimensionality. The analysis considers the feature type, as categorical variables require different variance measurement approaches than continuous ones. Returns a list of low-variance features that might be candidates for removal during feature selection, along with their variance scores.
    
    - `generate_exploration_report(output_dir='reports', filename='data_exploration_report.html', include_plots=True)`: Compiles all exploration findings into a comprehensive statistical report with key insights, organized in a structured, navigable format. The method creates an HTML report using templates from Jinja2, incorporating all statistics, visualizations, and insights gathered from previous analyses. The report includes sections for basic statistics, correlations, outliers, feature importance, missing values, and categorical analysis. When include_plots is True, it embeds visualizations directly in the HTML for an integrated view. The report highlights potential data issues, strong predictors, and recommendations for feature engineering or transformation. The method creates the output directory if it doesn't exist and saves the report with appropriate timestamps. Returns a summary DataFrame containing key insights extracted from the exploration process, providing a concise overview of findings.

This function improves code reliability by preventing errors due to inconsistent column name references. Returns the DataFrame with normalized column names.

- **detect_data_types(df, numeric_threshold=0.7)**: Intelligently identifies the appropriate data type for each column by analyzing content patterns rather than relying solely on pandas' default type inference. The function examines the proportion of numeric values in seemingly categorical columns to detect if they should be treated as numeric. The numeric_threshold parameter determines the minimum fraction of numeric values needed to classify a column as numeric. Returns two lists: one containing detected numeric columns and another with categorical columns.

- **create_feature_scatter_matrix(df, features, target=None, samples=1000)**: Generates a scatter plot matrix for a subset of important features to visualize their pairwise relationships and potential interactions. When the number of data points exceeds the samples parameter, the function performs strategic sampling to maintain visualization clarity while preserving distribution characteristics. If target is provided, points are colored according to target values to help identify patterns related to the outcome variable. Returns a figure object containing the scatter matrix visualization.
